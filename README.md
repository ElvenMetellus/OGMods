# Rain and Snow
[Forum post.](http://forums.wolfire.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=18407)  
I've included two maps which already have the scripts attached.
## Howto use:  
	1. Either put rainlevel.xml or snowlevel.xml in the main menu textbox.  
	2. Press Load.  

If you want your own level to have snow or rain edit your level xml file and add one of these:  
```
<Script>Data/Custom/gyrth/snow/Scripts/snow.as</Script>  
<Script>Data/Custom/gyrth/rain/Scripts/rain.as</Script>  
```
	
Last tested and working on alpha 209.
