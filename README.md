# Breakable Objects
[Forum post.](http://forums.wolfire.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=37384)  
I only made a breakable pot. Maybe I'll make more object types in the future.  
## Howto use:  
	1. Open up Data/Custom/gyrth/pot/Objects/pot_hotspot.xml.  
	2. Place it somewhere in the scene.  
	
Last tested and working on alpha 209.
