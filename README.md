# Aiming
[Forum post.](http://forums.wolfire.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=37404)  
I only made a breakable pot. Maybe I'll make more object types in the future.  
## Howto use:  
	1. Hold q to create an aiming line.  
	2. Move the mouse to aim at something.  
	3. Release q to shoot.
	
Last tested and working on alpha 209.
